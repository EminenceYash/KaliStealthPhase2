üîí Want Next-Level Anonymity? Privacy Layered Environment

# üß™ Kali Lab - Advanced Privacy & Anonymity Suite

This lab transforms a regular Kali Linux VM into a secure, stealthy hacking environment. It's built for black hat testing and ghost-mode browsing ‚Äî all while minimizing the chances of digital traces.

## üîê Key Components

### 1. **Kill Switch (Firewall Rules)**
Blocks **all internet traffic** except that which goes through your VPN. If the VPN fails ‚Äî you're offline, not exposed.

### 2. **MAC Address Spoofer**
Randomizes your MAC address every session to avoid device fingerprinting.

### 3. **DNS Leak Protection**
Hardcoded DNS servers (e.g., Cloudflare) + file locking prevent your DNS requests from leaking out of VPN/Tor tunnels.

### 4. **Privacy Boot Script**
A one-touch script to:
- Randomize MAC
- Activate Kill Switch
- Lock DNS
- Launch your preferred network mode (VPN, Tor, combo)
